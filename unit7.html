					<h3>Maintain visual correspondence to quantity</h3>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/saladbigmac.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>If we look at the left triangle on image above, the meats/dairy category shows that it accounts for 73.8% of food subsidies. Unfortunately, the author used 73.8% of the height of the triangle to represent this visually. Not even accounting for the horrid use of 3D, the surface area of the meat/dairy category actually represents more than 90% of the surface area of the triangle. In chapter 9, one of the main points Few makes is to maintain visual correspondence to quantity. The image above clearly is in violation of this concept. I would imagine that this is not intentional and a side effect of some form of artistic flair. We often see this issue arise in line graphs using time series data like in <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/blogs/makingmaineprosperous/199960701.html">this article</a> from the Portland Press Herald (image below).</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/pphGrowth.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>This is a little more subtle of an issue but we are visually led to believe that the increase is 233% instead of 88%. The example above is somewhat less offensive in that the axes are clearly labeled, the percentage increase is clearly identified and the start and end points are annotated. The graph does beg the question, what was gained by not starting the vertical axis at zero? Edward Tufte came up with a term to describe the discrepancy between the size of the effect stated and the size of effect shown -- <a href="http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=Lie_Factor">the lie factor</a>, which is simple the size of effect represented visually divided by the actual effect size. In the first example, the lie factor is about 1.2, and in the second example it is about 2.7. According to Tufte, to ensure the integrity of a graphic you want to keep the lie factor between 0.95 and 1.05. press herald examples</p>
					<h3 id="avoid-3d">Avoid 3D</h3>
					<p>3D graphics can be extremely valuable in many areas including many of the natural sciences. Rendering three dimensional images like the one below allow us to view patterns that would not normally be seen in 2D space.</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/good3d1.png" />
					</figure>
					<p>Visualization for exploratory analysis, provided you can navigate the 3D space accurately is highly valuable as well. That said, there are orders of magnitude more bad 3D graphics than good ones out there and unless you have an extremely good reason for creating one you should steer clear of them. One of the big issues with 3D graphics is they often inherently become misleading. If we examine the image from this Portland Press Herald story below, the graphic is using three axes (x,y,z) to represent two variables (category and spending cut amount). The tilt to show the third dimension alters the angle of the pie slice. For the largest cut category, Health and Human Services, the visualization should use an angle that represents 38.7% of the pie (or .387 * 360 = 139.32 degrees). If we actually measure the angle shown, it is 134.22 degrees, which would represent roughly 37.3% of the pie. There are also a few too many categories here to use a pie chart effectively. In this case, a bar chart would be a superior choice.</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/pressHpie3d.png" />
					</figure>
					<p>In my opinion, part of the reason for much of the horrible 3D visualizations we are exposed to is due to the ease in which we can create them in Excel. In addition to 3D visualization, the other often poorly implemented visual feature is animation. In short, if your intent is to inform you will probably be better off never using animation or 3D. If, however, your intent is to entertain then 3D and animation become legitimate considerations.</p>
					<h2>Component Level Design</h2>
					<p>Much of what Few covers in chapter 10 you would naturally do if you took the advice of the prior chapters. Because the chapter is so specifically clear in the component level design details, I'm going to use the opportunity to discuss a significant issue that should be in this chapter -- over plotting, and a couple of graph types that we haven't adequately covered: box plots; and banded time series.</p>
					<h3>Overplotting</h3>
					<p>Overlapping indistinguishable points is an exceptionally common issue with large data sets (or smaller data sets with a small range of values). This phenomenon is commonly called over-plotting. One of the classical ways to handle over-plotting is jittering and is still commonly used. The example below shows a visualization showing a scatterplot of automobile highway miles per gallon and engine displacement in liters. If we look at the chart, it appears there are only six observations of automobiles with 2.0 liter engines. In reality there are twenty-one observations with 2.0 liter engines.</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/mpgreg.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>Jittering involves nudging the points to the right or the left slightly and is shown below.</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/mpgjitter.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>Unfortunately, jittering isn't the simplest thing to do in Tableau. I actually jittered the data in the Excel spreadsheet by nudging the displacement by a random amount up to 0.03 liters to the left of the right. In Excel, this is trivial using the RANDBETWEEN function. In addition to not having a jitter option, Tableau doesn't include a random number generator. If I wanted to accomplish this solely in Tableau it would likely involve some workaround where I used SQL queries to generate a random jitter.</p>
					<p>An alternative to jitter is to lower the transparency of points so the higher concentration will get darker (shown below). When points completely overlap it is arguable whether or not this is superior to jitter.</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/mpgTrans.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>A better use of transparency is when you have a high concentration of points without 100% overlap. The graph below displays two thousand randomly generated points in a scatterplot.</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/xyReg.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>If I want to highlight the higher concentrations, decreasing the transparency to less than 100% is a great way to accomplish this (in this case I used 30%).</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/xyTrans.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>Although he doesn't include it in the text, Few has <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/over-plotting_in_graphs.pdf">written an article discussing possible solutions to over plotting</a>.</p>
					<h3>Box plots</h3>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/boxplot.png" />
					</figure>
					<p>Shown above, the classic box plot or &quot;box and whiskers plot&quot; was developed by an American mathematician, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey">John Tukey</a>, in 1977. It is a very compact graph that shows the quartiles of a specific variable. The &quot;box&quot; portion shows the upper and lower quartiles while the line inside the box shows the median. The whiskers vary in their use. In the image above, they show 1.5 times the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range">interquartile range</a> but they have also been used to show the maximum and minimum, a standard deviation above and below the mean, or a specific percentile. Few discusses the more generic &quot;boxes&quot; component but also seems to use the term &quot;box plot&quot; interchangeably throughout the book. In the chart above, the points represent outliers. In the videos I will cover creating traditional box plots in Tableau like the one below.</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/boxplot.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>But I will also discuss the creation of what are often called Tableau box plots (shown below) that add each individual point.</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/enhancedBoxplot.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>Box plots are a wonderful chart that are underutilized because they are not a default chart type in Excel. You <a href="http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/excel-box-and-whisker-diagrams-box-plots/">can create them in Excel</a> but this is somewhat difficult to do for the average user.</p>
					<h3 id="time-series">Time Series</h3>
					<p>In the final Tableau video, I construct a time series chart of historical stock prices for Tableau (DATA) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollinger_Bands">Bollinger Bands</a> which consist of a twenty day moving average of the stock and boundaries of two standard deviations away from that twenty day moving average. Bollinger bands are used to represent volatility.</p>
					<figure>
					<img src="assets/images/bbands.jpg" />
					</figure>
					<p>In the Tableau videos, I use table calculations. I start with a short video showing how I calculate the numerator for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">z-score</a> calculation. <a href="http://kb.tableausoftware.com/articles/knowledgebase/z-scores">Here is an article</a> on the z-score calculation in Tableau, <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/table-calculations">and another</a> explaining table calculations. They are there for reference and if they confuse/frustrate you don't get too down. Tableau calculations are a minuscule part of this class but can be exceptionally complex.</p>
